# 🏡 House Price Prediction System  

## 🚀 Project Overview  
The **House Price Prediction System** leverages **machine learning** to accurately estimate house prices based on multiple factors, such as **location, size, and market trends**. By analyzing historical housing data, the model generates insights that enable **data-driven decision-making** for real estate buyers, sellers, and investors.  

This project is built using **Python**, with model training and deployment on **Azure Machine Learning**. A **Flask-based web application** provides an intuitive interface for users to input data and receive instant price predictions.

## 💡 How It Works  
1. **Data Collection & Processing:** Historical housing data is cleaned, preprocessed, and enhanced with additional features (e.g., proximity to amenities, property age).  
2. **Model Training & Optimization:** Various **machine learning algorithms** are evaluated, with **hyperparameter tuning** performed for accuracy.  
3. **Feature Engineering:** Key features like **location, size, number of bedrooms, and renovations** are analyzed to enhance predictions.  
4. **Deployment & Web Interface:** A **Flask web application** allows users to input property details and receive instant price predictions.  
5. **Scalability & Hosting:** The model is deployed on **Azure Web App Service** for accessibility.
